				<p class = "info"> In a study by Harvard, researchers have seen that over 32.4% of the workforce is being underutilized on a daily basis.
				Organizr will create more productive teams that minimize wasted resources.
				</p>
				<p class = "info"> Organizr takes results from a unified standardized test (Strengthsfinder) and sorts people by groups of abilities.
				We feed into it the requirements of the project.
				Then, based upon the requirements of the project, it groups people up into teams and focuses on having a diverse portfolio as well as targeting people who the project heavily is dependent on.
